# CSS Advanced Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a continuation of the **HTML, advanced** project and focuses entirely on **CSS design and styling**. You will recreate a full webpage based on a designer-provided Figma file, applying advanced CSS concepts such as selectors, specificity, box model, and layout structure.

You must strictly follow the Figma design and ensure your HTML/CSS remains **clean, simple, and W3C‑compliant**.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

### **General Concepts**

* What CSS is
* How to apply styles to HTML elements
* What classes and selectors are
* How CSS specificity works
* How to compute CSS specificity values
* Box model properties in CSS
* How browsers load and render web pages

## 📝 Requirements

### **General**

* All files must end with a **new line**.
* A `README.md` file is **mandatory** at the root of the `css_advanced` directory.
* Do **not** use external libraries or frameworks.

## 🎨 Figma Resources

Access the final design here:

* **Page in Figma**: *(link provided in project)*
* **FIG file**: *(link provided in project)*
* Download required **images** from the project resources.

### Important Notes:

* If your computer lacks the required fonts, download:
